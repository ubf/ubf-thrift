@title Universal Binary Format and Thrift
@doc
This is UBF-THRIFT, a framework for integrating UBF, TBF, and Thrift.
This repository depends on the ubf open source repository.

_This repository is intended for production deployment and is deployed
in carrier-grade systems._

== Quick Start Recipe

To download, build, and test the ubf_thrift application in one shot,
please follow this recipe:

------
$ mkdir working-directory-name
$ cd working-directory-name
$ git clone https://github.com/ubf/ubf-thrift.git ubf_thrift
$ cd ubf_thrift
$ make deps clean compile test
------

== Documentation

=== Where should I start?

This README is a good first step.

The UBF User\'s Guide is the best next step.  Check out
http://ubf.github.com/ubf/ubf-user-guide.en.html for further
detailed information.

Eunit tests can be found in the test/eunit directory.  These tests
illustrate a generic module that uses UBF\'s contract manager for
checking Thrift requests and responses.

=== What is UBF?

UBF is the "Universal Binary Format", designed and implemented by Joe
Armstrong.  UBF is a language for transporting and describing complex
data structures across a network.  It has three components:

- UBF(a) is a "language neutral" data transport format, roughly
  equivalent to well-formed XML.
- UBF(b) is a programming language for describing types in UBF(a) and
  protocols between clients and servers.  This layer is typically
  called the "protocol contract".  UBF(b) is roughly equivalent to
  Verified XML, XML-schemas, SOAP and WDSL.
- UBF(c) is a meta-level protocol used between a UBF client and a UBF
  server.

See http://ubf.github.com/ubf for further details.

=== What is Thrift?

Thrift is a remote procedure call protocol.  See
http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/ for full details.
